The Crime Rate Prediction App is an intelligent system designed to analyze historical crime data 
and predict future crime trends using machine learning techniques. The application aims to assist 
law enforcement agencies, government bodies, and the general public in understanding crime 
patterns and making informed decisions to enhance public safety. The system collects and 
processes crime-related data such as location, time, crime type, and frequency to identify patterns 
and correlations.
