# Crime Rate Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The **Crime Rate Prediction** project is a machine learning–based web application that analyzes historical crime data to predict crime trends. The aim of this project is to understand crime patterns using data-driven techniques and demonstrate the practical application of Machine Learning concepts.

The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a simple web interface.
